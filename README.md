GA Weeks 1 - 7
======

This repository contains the bulk of code I wrote during the first 7 weeks of the Web Development Immersive course I took at General Assembly. It ranges from learning ruby and OOP basics during week 1 to building websites and single page apps in week 7. After week 7 projects became more independent and we changed the way we submitted them so they are broken up into different repositories.
