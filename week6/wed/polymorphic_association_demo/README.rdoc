Polymorphic Association
 When you have one model that could belong to any one of a set of models.
 Comments is the classic example.
 A comments could belong to a book, a video, an event or a photo.

Goals:

* Understand overview of polymorphic relationships.
* How to set up model relationships.
  * comment.rb: "belongs_to :commentable, polymorphic: true"
  * book.rb: "has_many :comments, as: :commentable, dependent: :destroy"
* How to set up the migration file.
  * commentable_id:integer, commentable_type:string
* How to use the active record relationship commands.
  * book.comments => finds all comments for a book
  * comment.commentable => to find model type for a comment

Check out seeded models
* $ rails c
* $ Book.all
* $ Comment.all
* $ b = Book.first
* $ b.comments
* $ b.destroy # associated comments are deleted too
* $ c = Comment.first
* $ c.commentable

## Exercise:
* fill in model relationship for "photos"
* create controller for "photos"
* create view pages for "photos"
